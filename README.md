# Traqura 

[Traqura](https://traqura.xyz/) is a mobile-first home inventory web app that allows users to maintain the location and value of all
their belongings. The frontend, built using React.js and styled with custom CSS, utilizes Axios to
make HTTP requests for user data. The FileStackAPI is used to store user images. The application
is secured using Spring Security 6.0 and token-based (JWT) authorization. The backend is a fully
decoupled REST API with full CRUD functionality and follows a three-layer codebase structure.
Users can create, edit, view, and delete spaces, sub-spaces, and items. Item and sub-space
locations and details are managed with Spring JPA and hibernate to communicate with MySQL.
User data is managed client-side with global state management and React Router 6.4.
