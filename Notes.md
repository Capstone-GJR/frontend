## NOTES

### Purpose of this branch 
- This branch is a working copy of main-dev prior to me making changing to the file names and folder structure on main-dev.

### Why didn't I use this branch for making adjustments?
- Changing names is the equivalent to deleting files for git purposes and something about merging after a few name changes has not worked great in the past.
  - Since main-dev is not technically main and we can easily replace it I figured this is the better option.
